# Hadamard_Performers

This is the final research project of the Machine Learning and High Dimensional Data Mining class taught by Prof. Krzysztof Choromanski at Columbia University.
In this repository, we implemented the tensorflow implementation of the FAVOR+ algorithm (Choromanski et al.,2020) https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/performer/fast_attention/tensorflow) by adding the optionnal functionnality of performing orthogonal feature mapping with SD-Product matrix (with Hadamard matrix as the structured matrix S) instead of Gaussian orthogonal matrix. This implementation is available on the fold Performers.
We run some fast tests using the numpy implemetation of the FAVOR+ algorithm edited by Teddy Koker: https://teddykoker.com/2020/11/performers/.
These experimentations are available in the notebook Hadamard_performers.ipynb in the fold Experimentations.
